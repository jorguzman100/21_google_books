## The development process

In order to accomplish the challenge, the following steps were done:

1. Define the purpose, and concept of the application.
2. Understand Google Books documentation.
3. Create React project.
4. Set the server up.
5. Define the Books model and seed.
6. Define the database connection in the server.
7. Define the application routes and controllers.
8. Define the Google Books route and controller.
9. Integrate React-Bootstrap.
10. Create application's pages and components.
11. Integrate front end with the back end.
12. Testing and documentation.

## The Output

With the described process we were able to create a useful, efficient, Google Books API based application.

2. As a user, I want to get the results of my search, so that I can see the volumes' information available like Title, Subtitle, Authors, Description, and Book image.
3. As a user, I want to have a link for each searched book, so that I can click on it and be re-directed externally to the Google book detail information.
4. As a user, i want to have a Save button, so that I can save the books of my preference.
5. As a user, I want to have a Saved books page, so that all my saved books are displayed.
6. As a user, I want to have Delete button on each of my saved books, so that I can delete the book from my saved books.
7. As a user, I want to get notification alerts after clicking on the Save and Delete buttons, so that I can be sure the success of my operations.
